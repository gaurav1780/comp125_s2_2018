# Built in lists in Java

## List interface

`List` is an interface in Java (for the time being, just assume that an *interface* is a collection of method headers - very loose definition but it will do for now). 

The **most frequently used** methods from `List` are:

| Method                    | Description                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `get(int): Object`          | returns Object at passed index (IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range)             |
| `size(): int`               | returns number of items in the list (0 if empty)                                                    |
| `add(Object)`               |  adds passed object at the end of the list (IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range) |
| `add(int, Object)`          | adds (at the given index) the object passed (IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range)                                              |
| `remove(int): Object` | removes and returns Object at given index. (IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range)                                  |
| `remove(Object): boolean` | removes first occurrence of given Object and returns `true`. Returns `false` if item not found |
| `contains(Object): boolean` | returns true if passed object exists in the list, false otherwise                                   |
| `indexOf(Object): int`      | returns first index at which passed object exists (-1 if it doesn't exist in the list)              |
| `lastIndexOf(Object): int`      | returns last index at which passed object exists (-1 if it doesn't exist in the list)              |
| `toString():String`         | returns String representation of the list (comma-separated items inside square brackets)            |

### Classes implementing List interface

The two classes that implement the methods from `List` interface are:

- **ArrayList**  &nbsp; - Stores items in an array (contiguous block of memory).
- **LinkedList** - Stores items linked to each other spread over the memory (not as a block).

These classes implement other methods as well but they definitely implement all methods from `List`.

The two classes differ in how the items are stored (we'll look at that in the sections (custom-built arraylist)[] and *custom-built linkedlist*).

## Creating and operating on List objects

### Creating a list

A list cannot hold variables of primitive data types (like `int`, `boolean`, `double`, `char`). Instead it must hold objects of corresponding classes provided by Java (`Integer`, `Boolean`, `Double`, `Character` respectively)

A list is typically parameterized with the type of objects it must hold. 

For those interested in learning about this, check out [Java Generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html)

#### Creating a List

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```

This creates a list that can hold integer values (as Integer objects).

You can similarly create a `LinkedList` object as,


```java
LinkedList<Double> grades = new LinkedList<Double>();
```

### Adding items at the end

```java
list.add(10);
list.add(70);
list.add(20);
list.add(90);
//list = [10, 70, 20, 90]
```

Inside object `list`, the values are held in an instance variable array named `elementData`. Thus, in this case, `list.elementData = {10, 70, 20, 90}`

NOTE: A `LinkedList` holds objects differently from an `ArrayList`. We'll talk more about that later.

### Adding items at arbitrary index

```java
list.add(0, 30);
//list = [30, 10, 70, 20, 90]

list.add(2, 4);
//list = [30, 10, 4, 70, 20, 90]

list.add(list.size(), 30); //after the last item
//list = [30, 10, 4, 70, 20, 90, 30]

list.add(20, -60); //throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
```

### Removing an item at a specific index

```java
list.remove(5);
//list = [30, 10, 4, 70, 20, 30]

list.remove(-3); //throws IndexOutOfBoundsException

list.remove(6); //throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
```

### Removing a specific object

The only scenario in which this is tricky is a list containing Integers, because the type of the object and the type of the index is the same (int or Integer).

```java
list.remove(4); 
//removes item at index 4, not the item 4. list = [30, 10, 4, 70, 30]

//if you want to remove THE ITEM 4, you must pass it as Integer object

list.remove((Integer)4); 
//removes item 4. list = [30, 10, 70, 30]
```

### Iterating over the list

Following example adds the items in the list

```java
int total = 0;
for(int i=0; i < list.size(); i++) {
	total = total + list.get(i);
}
//total = 30+10+70+30 = 140
```

### Checking existence and location of items in list
	
```java
//note: list = [30, 10, 70, 30]
boolean flag = list.contains(10);   //flag = true
boolean status = list.contains(20); //status = false

int idx1 = list.indexOf(70);        //idx1 = 2
int idx2 = list.indexOf(40);        //idx2 = -1
int idx3 = list.indexOf(30);        //idx3 = 0
int idx4 = list.lastIndexOf(30);    //idx4 = 3
```

### Storing list contents in a String or displaying it

```java
String str = list.toString(); //str = "[30, 10, 70, 30]"
System.out.println(list);     //toString() called, displays [30, 10, 70, 30]
```

## Passing lists to methods

Lists are passed to methods like any other object. Since a shallow copy of the passed list is made into the formal parameter, modifying the contents of a list in a method results in the contents of the passed list being modified too. 

## COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE 1

### Context

1. A list, `outcomes`, should be created so that it contains the outcomes of a "normal" 6-faced die (singular of dice) being rolled `N` times.
2. Store and display, a variable `nSixes`, that holds the number of times a 6 was rolled. 
3. Store and display, a variable `average`, that holds the average outcome.
4. Store and display, a variable `noTwoAdjSame`, that holds value `true` if none of two adjacent (one after the other) outcomes the same, `false` otherwise. 
5. Store and display, a variable `mostFreq`, that holds the most frequent outcome.

### Solution: [DiceRollSimulation.java](./DiceRollSimulation.java)

## Methods operating on lists 

Just like any other object, you can pass lists to methods. Example for task 3 (average) provided below:

### Method definition

```java
public static double getAverage(ArrayList<Integer> data) {
	int total = 0;
	for(int i=0; i < data.size(); i++) {
		total = total + data.get(i);
	}
	return total / (double)data.size();
}
```


### Method call

```java
double average = getAverage(list);
```

## COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE 2

### Context

Consider the Rectangle class defined in [Rectangle.java](./Rectangle.java)

1. Create a LinkedList of 20 rectangles, each having a random width and height (each between 1 and 8 - inclusive on both sides)
2. Display all rectangles with area of 10 or more.
3. Display the indx of the first rectangle whose area is more than the rectangle after it. 
4. Display the area of the biggest rectangle (in terms of area).
5. Create and display another list of rectangles named `squareList` containing all squares from your list.

### Solution: [RectangleClient.java](./RectangleClient.java)

	
# Practice project (homework)

Write a piece of code that,

1. Creates an ArrayList of String objects. 
2. Add 10 names of your choice to the list (first name followed be last name). 
3. Display the longest name in the list. 
4. Display the count of names that are more than 10 characters in length.
5. Display the index of the first name that ends with an 'n'. If no name ends with an 'n', display `no name ends with character 'n'`.
6. Display all names that begin with a specific letter. The list and the letter should be passed as parameters to the method that displays these names. 
7. Create another list, `shortNames`, with all names from your list that are less than 8 characters in length.
8. Sort your list in alphabetic order. Note that the String class contains `compareTo(String)` that orders the calling object and parameter object in alphabetic order.
