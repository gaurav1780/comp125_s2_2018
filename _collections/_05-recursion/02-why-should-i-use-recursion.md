# Why should I use recursion?

## Advantages

#### 1. Intuitiveness

Some solutions have an intuitive recursive design. Some examples (we assume n >= 0 for all examples):

1. x to the power of n:
	- `x`<sup>`n`</sup> = `x`<sup>`n-1`</sup> * `x` if n > 0
	- `x`<sup>`0`</sup> = 1
2. number of digits in an integer: 
	- `nDigits(n)` = `nDigits(n/10) + 1` if n > 0
	- `nDigits(0)` = 0
3. sum of the first n positive integers (1 + 2 + ... + n): 
	- `sum(n) = sum(n-1) + n` if n > 0
	- `sum(0)` = 0
	
#### 2. Complex problems

While trivial problems have fairly obvious recursive **and** iterative solutions, it's much easier to find a recursive solution to the more complex problems. For example, creating a random permutation of the word "super".
 
> random permutation of the word "super"
> = random character from "super" (say 'u') + random permutation of the word "sper"

> random permutation of the word "sper"
> = random character from "sper" (say 'r') + random permutation of the word "spe"

> random permutation of the word "spe"
> = random character from "spe" (say 's') + random permutation of the word "pe"

> random permutation of the word "pe"
> = random character from "pe" (say 'e') + random permutation of the word "p"

> random permutation of the word "p"
> = random character from "p" (has to be 'p') + random permutation of the word ""

> random permutation of the word ""
> = "" (end case)

Plugging the values back:

> random permutation of the word "p"
> = 'p' + ""
> = "p"

> random permutation of the word "pe"
> = 'e' + "p"
> = "ep"

> random permutation of the word "spe"
> = 's' + "ep"
> = "sep"

> random permutation of the word "sper"
> = 'r' + "sep"
> = "rsep"

> random permutation of the word "super"
> = 'u' + "rsep"
> = "ursep"

#### 3. Recursive data structures

Advanced data structures (such as linked lists, trees and graphs) are recursive in nature and it is logical to operate recursively on them.
