# Pen and paper methodology

In the unit, we shall be doing a lot of work on computers, where your programs are auto-marked by the machine and instant feedback is given. However, one skill is critical for good understanding of programming and improving problem solving skills -

We will start with trace of some programs to establish what we expect students to do while tracing through code.

> ## Tracing conditions
> Trace the flow of the following program and determine the value of `result` at the end of it.
> <script src="https://gist.github.com/gaurav1780/767824769b5456ddb080e63d84124d70.js"></script>
> > ## Solution
> >`a < b` is `true`
> >
> >`b % a == 0` is `true`
> >
> >`a % 2 == 0` is `false`
> >
> >The expression becomes `true && true && false`
> >
> >This is `false`
> >
> >Hence, the `else` block executes and `result` becomes `b (10)`.
