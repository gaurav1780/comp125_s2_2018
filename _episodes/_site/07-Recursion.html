<p>Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with
other people.  We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.</p>

<p>Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it’s easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone’s laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> or
<a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> to hold those master copies; we’ll explore the pros
and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.</p>

<p>Let’s start by sharing the changes we’ve made to our current project with the
world.  Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called <code class="highlighter-rouge">planets</code>:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/github-create-repo-01.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)" /></p>

<p>Name your repository “planets” and then click “Create Repository”:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/github-create-repo-02.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)" /></p>

<p>As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/github-create-repo-03.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)" /></p>

<p>This effectively does the following on GitHub’s servers:</p>

<div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
$ git init
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you remember back to the earlier <a href="./04-changes.html">lesson</a> where we added and
commited our earlier work on <code class="highlighter-rouge">mars.txt</code>, we had a diagram of the local repository
which looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/git-staging-area.svg" alt="The Local Repository with Git Staging Area" /></p>

<p>Now that we have two repositories, we need a diagram like this:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg" alt="Freshly-Made GitHub Repository" /></p>

<p>Note that our local repository still contains our earlier work on <code class="highlighter-rouge">mars.txt</code>, but the
remote repository on GitHub appears empty as it doesn’t contain any files yet.</p>

<p>The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a <a href="/reference/#remote">remote</a> for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to
identify it:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/github-find-repo-string.png" alt="Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub" /></p>

<p>Click on the ‘HTTPS’ link to change the <a href="/reference/#protocol">protocol</a> from
SSH to HTTPS.</p>

<blockquote class="callout">
  <h2 id="https-vs-ssh">HTTPS vs. SSH</h2>

  <p>We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.  After
the workshop you may want to set up SSH access, which is a bit more secure, by
following one of the great tutorials from
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">GitHub</a>,
<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git">Atlassian/BitBucket</a>
and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2014/03/04/add-ssh-key-screencast/">GitLab</a>
(this one has a screencast).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../fig/github-change-repo-string.png" alt="Changing the Repository URL on GitHub" /></p>

<p>Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local <code class="highlighter-rouge">planets</code> repository, and run
this command:</p>

<div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad’s: the only
difference should be your username instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">vlad</code>.</p>

<p>We can check that the command has worked by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote -v</code>:</p>

<div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git remote -v
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="output highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The name <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code> is a local nickname for your remote repository. We could use
something else if we wanted to, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code> is by far the most common choice.</p>

<p>Once the nickname <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code> is set up, this command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:</p>

<div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git push origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="output highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.

</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="callout">
  <h2 id="proxy">Proxy</h2>

  <p>If the network you are connected to uses a proxy, there is a chance that your
last command failed with “Could not resolve hostname” as the error message. To
solve this issue, you need to tell Git about the proxy:</p>

  <div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
$ git config --global https.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>When you connect to another network that doesn’t use a proxy, you will need to
tell Git to disable the proxy using:</p>

  <div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git config --global --unset http.proxy
$ git config --global --unset https.proxy
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="callout">
  <h2 id="password-managers">Password Managers</h2>

  <p>If your operating system has a password manager configured, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code> will
try to use it when it needs your username and password.  For example, this
is the default behavior for Git Bash on Windows. If you want to type your
username and password at the terminal instead of using a password manager,
type:</p>

  <div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ unset SSH_ASKPASS
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>in the terminal, before you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code>.  Despite the name, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_requesting_credentials">git uses
<code class="highlighter-rouge">SSH_ASKPASS</code> for all credential
entry</a>, so
you may want to unset <code class="highlighter-rouge">SSH_ASKPASS</code> whether you are using git via SSH or
https.</p>

  <p>You may also want to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">unset SSH_ASKPASS</code> at the end of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code>
to make git default to using the terminal for usernames and passwords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/github-repo-after-first-push.svg" alt="GitHub Repository After First Push" /></p>

<blockquote class="callout">
  <h2 id="the--u-flag">The ‘-u’ Flag</h2>

  <p>You may see a <code class="highlighter-rouge">-u</code> option used with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code> in some documentation.  This
option is synonymous with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--set-upstream-to</code> option for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">git branch</code>
command, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so
that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> command can be used without any arguments. To do this,
simply use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push -u origin master</code> once the remote has been set up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:</p>

<div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git pull origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="output highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already
synchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on
GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="github-gui">GitHub GUI</h2>

  <p>Browse to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">planets</code> repository on GitHub.
Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says “XX commits” (where “XX” is some number).
Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.
What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
How would you get that same information in the shell?</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
    <p>The left-most button (with the picture of a clipboard) copies the full identifier of the commit to the clipboard. In the shell, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log</code> will show you the full commit identifier for each commit.</p>

    <p>When you click on the middle button, you’ll see all of the changes that were made in that particular commit. Green shaded lines indicate additions and red ones removals. In the shell we can do the same thing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git diff</code>. In particular, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git diff ID1..ID2</code> where ID1 and ID2 are commit identifiers (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">git diff a3bf1e5..041e637</code>) will show the differences between those two commits.</p>

    <p>The right-most button lets you view all of the files in the repository at the time of that commit. To do this in the shell, we’d need to checkout the repository at that particular time. We can do this with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout ID</code> where ID is the identifier of the commit we want to look at. If we do this, we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterwards!</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="github-timestamp">GitHub Timestamp</h2>

  <p>Create a remote repository on GitHub.  Push the contents of your local
repository to the remote.  Make changes to your local repository and push
these changes.  Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the
<a href="/reference/#timestamp">timestamps</a> of the files.  How does GitHub record
times, and why?</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <h2 id="solution-1">Solution</h2>
    <p>GitHub displays timestamps in a human readable relative format (i.e. “22 hours ago” or “three weeks ago”). However, if you hover over the timestamp, you can see the exact time at which the last change to the file occurred.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="push-vs-commit">Push vs. Commit</h2>

  <p>In this lesson, we introduced the “git push” command.
How is “git push” different from “git commit”?</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <h2 id="solution-2">Solution</h2>
    <p>When we push changes, we’re interacting with a remote repository to update it with the changes we’ve made locally (often this corresponds to sharing the changes we’ve made with others). Commit only updates your local repository.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="fixing-remote-settings">Fixing Remote Settings</h2>

  <p>It happens quite often in practice that you made a typo in the
remote URL. This exercise is about how to fix this kind of issue.
First start by adding a remote with an invalid URL:</p>

  <div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add broken https://github.com/this/url/is/invalid
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Do you get an error when adding the remote? Can you think of a
command that would make it obvious that your remote URL was not
valid? Can you figure out how to fix the URL (tip: use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote
-h</code>)? Don’t forget to clean up and remove this remote once you are
done with this exercise.</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <h2 id="solution-3">Solution</h2>
    <p>We don’t see any error message when we add the remote (adding the remote tells git about it, but doesn’t try to use it yet). As soon as we try to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code> we’ll see an error message. The command <code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote set-url</code> allows us to change the remote’s URL to fix it.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="github-license-and-readme-files">GitHub License and README files</h2>

  <p>In this section we learned about creating a remote repository on GitHub, but when you initialized your
GitHub repo, you didn’t add a README.md or a license file. If you had, what do you think would have happened when
you tried to link your local and remote repositories?</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <h2 id="solution-4">Solution</h2>
    <p>In this case, since we already had a README file in our own (local) repository, we’d see a merge conflict (when git realises that there are two versions of the file and asks us to reconcile the differences).</p>
